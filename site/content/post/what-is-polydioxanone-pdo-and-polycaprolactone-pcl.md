### **Polydioxanone (PDO)**

The most commonly used to stitch sutures during surgeries and procedures, the benefits of polydioxanone (PDO) threads last from 6 to 12 months. Once the threads have been completely dissolving and absorbed into the skin after six months, they increase the production and synthesis of collagen within the skin up to 12 months.

The function of [pdo threads](https://laboderm-skin.com/glamour-pdo-threads/) is known to trigger changes in the dermis and [](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/9140386917966371801/7959265683760239038#)[pcl threads](https://laboderm-skin.com/glamour-pcl-threads-twist/). Numerous studies have demonstrated that it's effective in reducing the size of pores and wrinkles that are fine. In addition, it's able to stimulate collagen production in the dermal matrix , which can enhance the thickening of papillary dermis.

PDO threads may also cause changes to tissues when they are inserted within the subcutaneous layer because PMN cells, such as the eosinophile are collected to form tissue granulation around the thread upon the thread's insertion. It was observed in a few studies that there's a lot of connective tissue with collagenous structure in the granulation tissues that have been formed.

A few studies have also revealed that the newly formed connective tissue collagenous converges to the fibrous connective tissue, causing an "merging phenomenon". This effect triggers an inflammation reaction in the region around where the thread is located and through mechanotransduction, it spreads by waves into the tissues surrounding it.

In the granulation tissue newly created near the threads myofibroblasts and fibroblasts have been reported to have been detected. This suggests that PDO threads have the ability to improve the elasticity of skin around the procedure. They also, through myofibroblasts' effect, make the skin more elastic.

Additionally the fat cells have been discovered to be been destroyed by the granulation tissues within the treatment area which proves it is true that PDO threads, if utilized properly, are efficient in shaping the face as well as contouring and rejuvenation techniques.

### **Polycaprolactone (PCL)**

While not as widely employed or popular as PDO and PLLA (both), polyucaprolactone (PCL) threads are one that can last for up to 2 years. It is because PCL's chemical bonds as well as structures in PCL are more durable and complex, which means it takes longer to dissolve completely. The slow rate of degrading PCL threads allows it to be placed into the tissues around it over a long period of time, giving a more lasting effect. PCL is also recognized to be extremely effective in stimulating collagen production when in comparison with PDO as well as PLLA. When it dissolves, the material disintegrates into nontoxic substances. Even after the thread has disintegrated collagen production could last for up to a year.
